            <h2>About the art</h2>

            <p>Every image on this site was generated by AI models. No human artist drew any of it.</p>

            <p>I can't draw to save my life. I've wanted to turn our D&amp;D campaign into a comic for years, and AI image generation is the only way it was ever going to happen. These strips are a personal project born out of love for the story and the people who played it. I'm not selling anything, not running ads, not seeking to make money from this in any way.</p>

            <p>If you enjoy web comics, please support the people who actually make them for a living. Here are two of the best:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Penny Arcade</a> — running since 1998, still going strong.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.oglaf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oglaf</a> — frequently brilliant, frequently NSFW.</li>
            </ul>
